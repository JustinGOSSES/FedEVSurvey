# FedEVSurvey
#### Quick data exploration of NASA-specific subset of Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey

data and overview reports can be downloaded from: https://www.fedview.opm.gov/2015/About/



Created both as an example of what you can do in a Jupyter notebook running python in terms of data exploration and visualization & as an example of working in python when the dataset is too big for Excel.

## NOTE: the data file that is read into the jupyter notebook isn't in this repo as it was very large. You can download your own copy of evs2015_PRDF_trend.csv from the link above. 

Also - The html file included is an HTML conversion of the jupyter notebook. It looks almost identical but won't run any actual python code.
