# FedEVSurvey
#### Quick data exploration of NASA-specific subset of Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey

data and overview reports can be downloaded from: https://www.fedview.opm.gov/2015/About/



Created both as an example of what you can do in a Jupyter notebook running python in terms of data exploration and visualization & as an example of working in python when the dataset is too big for Excel.
